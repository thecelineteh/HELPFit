A collaborative project with [Daenise](https://github.com/Daenise) for the course BIT210 Web Programming at HELP University, Malaysia. Our goal was to develop a responsive web application based on the case study of HELPFit, which is an initiative that aims to connect fitness trainers and members. An earlier version, which is the HELPFit front-end web design is available [here](https://github.com/thecelineteh/HELPFit-Design).   

Similar to the course BIT216 Software Engineering Principles for the [JEE](https://github.com/thecelineteh/Jinjang-Empowerment-Ebusiness) case study project which I collaborated with [AdrianFoo97](https://github.com/AdrianFoo97), the following coding platforms/languages are used:
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap 
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL
* XAMPP (local server)
